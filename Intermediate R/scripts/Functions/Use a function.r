# Calculate the average number of views for both linkedin and facebook
# and assign the result to avg_li and avg_fb, respectively.
# Experiment with different types of argument matching!
# Print out both avg_li and avg_fb.

# The linkedin and facebook vectors have already been created for you
linkedin <- c(16, 9, 13, 5, 2, 17, 14)

# Calculate average number of views
avg_li <- mean(linkedin)
avg_fb <- mean(facebook)

# Inspect avg_li and avg_fb
